# IAVA Aggregation Reporting

This works by by aggregating all CSV files. (Approx. 48).

Files are moved and backups are saved. Next, an analysis is peformed to enable comparisons across all locations.

Analysis is then merged to historical to create longitudnal data.

Visuals are then created and dropped into a PPT for review.

PPT is posted to sharepoint document library, and stakeholders are emailed.
